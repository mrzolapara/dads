    "# Descriptive Measures\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, Descriptive measures are brief descriptive coefficients that summarize a given data set, which can be either a representation of the entire population or some sample of population. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, here we are going to describe about the following descriptive measures of statistics in Jupyter notebook using various python libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Measures of Central Tendency\n",
    "- Measures of Variation\n",
    "\n",
    "#  1) Measures of Central Tendency\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive measures that indicate where the center or most typical value of a data set lies are called Measures of Central Tendency. These are often called averages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, We will discuss about the most important measures of central tendency which are the Mean, Meadian and Mode. \n",
    "The mean and median apply only to quantitative data, whereas the mode can be used with either quantitative or qualitative data. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean of a dataset is its arithmatic mean. The mean of dataset is the sum of the observations divided by the number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example\n",

    "Here, we see one example...\n",
